# Libreria de numeros complejos 

This is a library that introduces you into the Complex space.You can find out fuctions between Complex numbers, Complex Matrices and Complex Vectors. 
In this project we are assuming that every real number is a complex number which can be written with its value as a Real component and 0 as a Imaginary component.
